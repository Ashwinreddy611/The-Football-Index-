## **User Stories**

### **User Experience (UX)**

#### **First Time Visitor Goals:**

a) As a first time visitor I would like to quickly and easily comprehend the idea the website is attempting to communicate to me.

b) The website should deliver on the functionality it is promising and there should be no visual bugs that comprimise the aesthetic of the website. 

c) As the premise of the website is to provide information for the past eleven seasons in the premier league, as a first time user i would expect all information would be  100% accurate. 

#### **Returning Visitor Goals:**

a) As a returning visitor I would expect updated information every year and for the current season accurate data for every game week.

b) When returning to the site I would expect there to be updated leagues and sections to the site i.e data from other leagues that is consistently being updated in the same way as the premier league data is being updated. 

c) Also when returning I would expect the site to maintain it's aformentioned functionality with no visual or structural bugs that would affect the newly added sections to the *Football Index Site*.

#### **Frequent Visitor Goals:** 

a) As a frequent visitor, I have all the expectations of a First time and returning visitor as well as the implementation of further features for the long term sustainability of the site i.e predicted line-ups for the coming game-week, betting odds at the start of the season for the winner and a player ratings system for numeric performance (accumalation of assists, goals, pass accuaracy etc.) of every player after every game. 


### **Design**

#### **Colour Theme** 
* The colours chosen for *The Football Index* site are: blue, green and white. The green was chosen for its imagery of the football pitch which is the center of what *The Football Index* is about. 

#### **Imagery**

#### **Typography**
In terms of typography the fonts Big Shoulders Stencil and Orbitron. *The Big Shoulder Font* was used due to it's visual connotations to tech. This fits the theme of the site of scouring the web for the data we football fans need. The *orbitron* font was used due to it's sleek and bold nature which I personally think is a very complimentary look to the *Big Shoulder Font*.
