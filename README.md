## **User Stories**

### **User Experience (UX)**

#### **First Time Visitor Goals:**

a) As a first time visitor I would like to quickly and easily comprehend the idea the website is attempting to communicate to me.

b) The website should deliver on the functionality it is promising and there should be no visual bugs that comprimise the aesthetic of the website. 

c) As the premise of the website is to provide information for the past eleven seasons in the premier league, as a first time user i would expect all information would be  100% accurate. 

#### **Returning Visitor Goals:**

a) As a returning visitor I would expect updated information every year and for the current season accurate data for every game week.

b) When returning to the site I would expect there to be updated leagues and sections to the site i.e data from other leagues that is consistently being updated in the same way as the premier league data is being updated. 

c) Also when returning I would expect the site to maintain it's aformentioned functionality with no visual or structural bugs that would affect the newly added sections to the *Football Index Site*.

#### **Frequent Visitor Goals:** 

a) As a frequent visitor, I have all the expectations of a First time and returning visitor as well as the implementation of further features for the long term sustainability of the site i.e predicted line-ups for the coming game-week, betting odds at the start of the season for the winner and a player ratings system for numeric performance (accumalation of assists, goals, pass accuaracy etc.) of every player after every game.
